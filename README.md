# Covid-19-App

Apparently free and correct information with no personal gain on my end is against Google's policy so they continue to deny my app on the play store. Im quite proud of my first app so you can only download the apk for now. Maybe they will allow me to upload it when the whole virus is over? Until then please enjoy? 

This is a covid-19 information app on android studio. It currently works as a web scraping app finding resources from around the web
and presents them in an easy to visualise way. Some anychart is used too.
