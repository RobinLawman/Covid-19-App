# Covid-19-App

This is a covid-19 information app on android studio. It currently works as a web scraping app finding resources from around the web
and presents them in an easy to visualise way. Some anychart is used too.

Currently having some struggles with google play store to get it online. But this is what it should look like when its 
available to download.
